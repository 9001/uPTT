# uPTT
global push-to-talk

unmutes your microphone while you hold a userdefined hotkey then mutes it

good for using discord in a browser

the exe will create `uptt-off.wav` and `uptt-on.wav` if they dont exist, replace them with the sfx you want

note the readme in [./uPTT/CoreAudioApi](./uPTT/CoreAudioApi) as that is under the zlib/libpng license and not my code
